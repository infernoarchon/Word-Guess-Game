# Word-Guess-Game

## Introduction

This is a simple hangman game where the player has to guess a classical composer one letter at a time, starring Concerto the evil musician from little-known adult cartoon Rick and Morty. 

## Special Thanks
Thanks to my classical homies for 400 years of awesome music.  :pray:
