# Word-Guess-Game

This is a simple hangman game where the player has to guess a classical composer one letter at a time, starring Concerto the evil musician from popular adult cartoon show Rick and Morty. 

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to my classical homies for 400 years of awesome music as well as Dan and Justin :pray:
